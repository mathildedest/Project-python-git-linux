## Quant A – Univariate - Single Asset Analysis Module


The goal of Quant A is to build a **single asset dashboard** using Python and Streamlit, with:
- live price fetching
- local data storage
- simple trading strategies
- basic risk metrics
- a daily report generated automatically with cron on Linux

---

## Project structure

- `app.py`  
  Main Streamlit application (dashboard).

- `requirements.txt`  
  Python dependencies.

- `scripts/daily_report.py`  
  Script used to generate a daily text report.

- `data/` (not versioned)  
  Contains the stored prices (`prices.csv`).

- `reports/` (not versioned)  
  Contains daily reports generated by the script.

The folders `data/` and `reports/` are ignored with `.gitignore` because they are generated automatically.

---

## Streamlit dashboard (Quant A)

The dashboard is built with **Streamlit** and focuses on **one asset at a time**.

Main features:
- choose an asset and a currency
- fetch the current price from an API
- save prices locally in a CSV file
- display stored price history
- run simple backtests
- compute basic metrics

The application is intentionally simple and readable.

## Asset and data source

For this project, the asset used is **Bitcoin** with prices in **EUR**.

Prices are fetched using a public API (CoinGecko).
Because the API has rate limits, prices are saved locally and reused for analysis.

---

## Trading strategies implemented

The project includes **at least two simple strategies**:

### 1. Buy and Hold
- Buy the asset at the first available price
- Hold it until the end of the dataset
- Used as a reference strategy

### 2. Moving Average Crossover (SMA)
- Two simple moving averages (short and long)
- Buy signal when short MA crosses above long MA
- Sell signal when short MA crosses below long MA

The strategies are basic by design and easy to understand.

---

## Metrics computed

For each strategy, the following metrics are computed:
- final value
- annualized volatility (simple)
- maximum drawdown

The metrics are calculated directly from the stored price data.

---

## Daily report (Python script)

A separate Python script generates a **daily report** from the stored prices.

Script:
- `scripts/daily_report.py`

Input:
- `data/prices.csv`

Output:
- `reports/report_YYYY-MM-DD.txt` (UTC date)

Content of the report:
- number of observations
- open price
- close price
- annualized volatility (simple)
- maximum drawdown (buy and hold)

The report is a simple text file.

---

## Automation with cron (Linux)

The daily report is automated using **cron** on a Linux environment (WSL).

Because recent Ubuntu versions use an externally managed Python environment, a **virtual environment (venv)** is used.

The cron job runs every day at **20:00**:

```bash
0 20 * * * cd /home/mathilde_dest/Project-python-git-linux && /home/mathilde_dest/Project-python-git-linux/venv/bin/python scripts/daily_report.py >> reports/cron.log 2>&1
