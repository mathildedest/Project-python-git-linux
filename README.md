## Quant A – Univariate - Single Asset Analysis Module


The goal of Quant A is to build a **single asset dashboard** using Python and Streamlit, with:
- live price fetching
- local data storage
- simple trading strategies
- basic risk metrics
- a daily report generated automatically with cron on Linux

---

## Project structure

- `app.py`  
  Main Streamlit application (dashboard).

- `requirements.txt`  
  Python dependencies.

- `scripts/daily_report.py`  
  Script used to generate a daily text report.

- `data/` (not versioned)  
  Contains the stored prices (`prices.csv`).

- `reports/` (not versioned)  
  Contains daily reports generated by the script.

The folders `data/` and `reports/` are ignored with `.gitignore` because they are generated automatically.

---

## Streamlit dashboard (Quant A)

The dashboard is built with **Streamlit** and focuses on **one asset at a time**.

Main features:
- choose an asset and a currency
- fetch the current price from an API
- save prices locally in a CSV file
- display stored price history
- run simple backtests
- compute basic metrics

The application is intentionally simple and readable.
Because CoinGecko is a free public API, rate limits may occur if too many requests are sent in a short time.

---

## Asset and data source

For this project, the dashboard focuses on one asset at a time (e.g. Bitcoin or Ethereum).

Prices are fetched using a public API (CoinGecko).
Because the API has rate limits, prices are saved locally and reused for analysis.

---

## Trading strategies implemented

The project includes **at least two simple strategies**:

### 1. Buy and Hold
- Buy the asset at the first available price
- Hold it until the end of the dataset
- Used as a reference strategy

### 2. Moving Average Crossover (SMA)
- Two simple moving averages (short and long)
- Buy signal when short MA crosses above long MA
- Sell signal when short MA crosses below long MA

The strategies are basic by design and easy to understand.

---

## Metrics computed

For each strategy, the following metrics are computed:
- final value
- annualized volatility (simple)
- maximum drawdown

The metrics are calculated directly from the stored price data.

---

## Daily report (Python script)

A separate Python script generates a **daily report** from the stored prices.

Script:
- `scripts/daily_report.py`

Input:
- `data/prices.csv`

Output:
- `reports/report_YYYY-MM-DD.txt` (UTC date)

Content of the report:
- number of observations
- open price
- close price
- annualized volatility (simple)
- maximum drawdown (buy and hold)

The report is a simple text file.

---

## Automation with cron (Linux)

The daily report is automated using **cron** on a Linux environment (WSL).

Because recent Ubuntu versions use an externally managed Python environment, a **virtual environment (venv)** is used.

The cron job runs every day at **20:00**:

```bash
0 20 * * * cd /home/mathilde_dest/Project-python-git-linux && /home/mathilde_dest/Project-python-git-linux/venv/bin/python scripts/daily_report.py >> reports/cron.log 2>&1
```

How to run Quant A

1. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

2. Run the Streamlit app
streamlit run app.py

3. Open the dashboard in a browser

## Quant B - Multivariate - Multi-Asset Portfolio Module

The goal of Quant B is to extend the project to multiple assets and build a portfolio analysis dashboard using Python and Streamlit.

This module focuses on :

- simultaneous analysis of several assets

- portfolio construction with user-defined weights

- diversification analysis

- portfolio performance and risk metrics

- clear and interactive visualizations

Quant B complements Quant A by moving from single-asset analysis to multi-asset portfolio analysis.

## Project structure (Quant B)

- `quant_b_portfolio.py`: portfolio computations and statistics
- `quant_b_dashboard.py`: Streamlit dashboard logic
- `quant_b_app.py`: standalone entry point for Quant B

`quant_b_portfolio.py`

Back-end logic of the Quant B module.

Responsibilities :

- retrieve historical prices for multiple assets

- build a price matrix

- compute asset returns

- compute portfolio returns based on weights

- compute basic portfolio statistics

`quant_b_dashboard.py`

Streamlit dashboard logic for the Quant B module.

Responsibilities :

- user interaction (asset selection, weights, parameters)

- data visualization

- portfolio comparison and metrics display

This file does not modify 'app.py' and is fully independent.

`quant_b_app.py`

Standalone Streamlit entry point for Quant B.

It allows the Quant B module to be run independently without touching the Quant A application.

Command to launch :

```bash
streamlit run quant_b_app.py
```

## Streamlit dashboard (Quant B)

The Quant B dashboard allows the user to analyze a multi-asset portfolio interactively.

Main features

- select at least 3 assets simultaneously

- choose the historical depth (number of days)

- load price data dynamically from an API

- assign custom portfolio weights

- visualize individual assets and portfolio performance

- analyze diversification through correlation

The dashboard is intentionally simple and readable.

## Assets and data source

The assets used in Quant B are cryptocurrencies :

- Bitcoin (BTC)

- Ethereum (ETH)

- Solana (SOL)

- Ripple (XRP)

Prices are retrieved using the CoinGecko public API.

All prices are expressed in EUR.

No API key is required, and the application handles API errors gracefully.

## Portfolio construction

The user defines target weights for each asset (in percentage).

Key assumptions :

- weights are normalized so the total equals 100%

- no transaction costs

- no slippage

- static weights (buy & hold portfolio)

The goal is to illustrate portfolio allocation, not to optimize it.

## Visualizations

The dashboard includes several charts:

## 1. Normalized price series

All asset prices are normalized to 1 at the start date.

Purpose :

- compare performance independently of price levels

## 2. Portfolio vs individual assets

The cumulative value of the portfolio is plotted alongside individual assets.

Purpose :

- visualize the diversification effect

- compare portfolio performance to single assets

## 3. Correlation matrix

A correlation matrix of asset returns is displayed as a heatmap.

Purpose:

- analyze relationships between assets

- identify diversification potential

## Portfolio metrics

The following indicators are computed for the portfolio :

- final value (base 1)

- annualized return (simple)

- annualized volatility

- maximum drawdown

These metrics provide a simple but effective overview of portfolio performance and risk. 

## Design choices

The Quant B module is designed to be :

- simple and readable

- fully independent from Quant A

- focused on educational clarity rather than optimization

- robust to missing data and API errors

The goal is to demonstrate core portfolio concepts:
diversification, correlation, risk, and performance.
